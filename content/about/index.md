Thanks for finding my blog. My background mostly centers around systems and infrastructure programming but I dabble in the full stack as much as possible. I currently live in New York City and have resided here since 2006. I live with my wife Katie and our identical twins. I've been working professionally since the year 2000 and have worked as an engineer, engineering manager, and startup CTO over the years. I love debugging both systems and people problems.

### my philosophy 

I believe that if you are using free software that its important to give back in some form or fashion, whether its documentation, bugfixes, entire libraries, or just helping give feedback. The idea behind this blog follows that philosophy.  I would like to share with people some of the things Iâ€™ve learned over the years.

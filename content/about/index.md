Hello! Thanks for finding my blog. I&#8217;m not sure if you want to know more about me or not but here you are. My background mostly centers around systems and infrastructure programming but am as full stack as needed for a given project that I might have in mind. Anyway, I live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" target="_blank">New York City</a> and have resided here since 2006, and live with my wife <a href="http://katiejanephoto.com" target="_blank">Katie</a> and our identical twins. I&#8217;m currently CTO at [Primary.com][1] which is an amazing place to buy kids clothes. 

I believe that if you are using free software that its important to give back in some form or fashion, whether its documentation, bugfixes, entire libraries, or just helping give feedback. The idea behind this blog follows that philosophy.  I would like to share with people some of the things I&#8217;ve learned over the years.  Many of the things I write here are just references for me because it can be helpful to document little things along the way and some are automated ways that I&#8217;ve learned to make various things easier.

Make sure these parameters exists on the primary&#8217;s my.cnf:

log-bin=/data02/mysql/msqlbinlog
   
server-id = 1

if it doesn&#8217;t exist put it in and restart mysql on the primary

&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

Make sure this exists on the slave DB:

server-id = 2
   
master-host = master\_host\_db
   
master-user = repl
   
master-password = somepassword
   
replicate-do-db = takkle

&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

Issue this command on the primary:

GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON \*.\* TO &#8216;repl&#8217;@&#8217;%.mydomain.com&#8217; IDENTIFIED BY &#8216;slavepass&#8217;;

(for 3.23 use FILE instead of REPLICATION SLAVE)

** you might have to replace &#8216;%.mydomain.com&#8217; with the machine name or IP

** note that just doing % as a hostname doesn&#8217;t seem to work for replication, but then you probably shouldn&#8217;t do that&#8230;

&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

Now, dump out the primary DB:

mysqldump &#8211;opt &#8211;master-data -v -u root > all_dbs.sql

that will dump all dbs; the &#8211;master-data will ensure a <tt>GRANT MASTER TO...</tt> is written into the SQL dump, which records the position in the binlog

then move all_dbs.sql to slave server

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

Log in to the command line at the slave server:

issue:

slave stop

Then exit and go back to command line on the slave machine:

mysql -u root < all_dbs.sql This may take a while on a large database; also don't forget to add <tt>-p</tt> if you need a password since MySQL doesn&#8217;t prompt by default.

The slave &#8221;should&#8221; have the synchronisation information for the binlogs from the <tt>CHANGE MASTER TO...</tt> which we put into the SQL dump using the option as described above. However, the statement in the dump will only contain the binlog file and position; you need to issue a second one to set up the hostname, replication user and password (obviously, <tt>mysqldump</tt> couldn&#8217;t know these for sure).

CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER\_HOST=&#8217;master.domain.somewhere&#8217;, MASTER\_USER=&#8217;user\_you\_set\_up\_above&#8217;, MASTER\_PASSWORD=&#8217;password\_you\_set\_up_above&#8217;;

Then restart the slave and see if it&#8217;s running:

SLAVE START;
   
SHOW SLAVE STATUS;

If you find it&#8217;s stuck in &#8220;connecting to master&#8221; and checks at the master using <tt>netstat</tt> or similar indicate that it does connect, but gets thrown out quickly, this tends to indicate the username or password is mistyped.

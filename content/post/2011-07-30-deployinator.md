I&#8217;ve been meaning to post more, but have been so busy lately at <a href="http://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a> its been hard to find time. Going to get better at that! In the meantime, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kastner" target="_blank">Erik Kastner</a> and I just got back from <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011" target="_blank">OSCON</a> and gave a talk about removing the cultural barriers that come as a result of unecessary process.

We also open sourced the tool we use to deploy code over 30 times a day <a href="http://github.com/etsy/deployinator" target="_blank">here on github</a>

If you&#8217;re interested, here are the slides from our talk:

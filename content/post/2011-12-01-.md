## The Guts

So given all that, we can look at a bit of the code.  The guts of the app are in the <a title="songs.js" href="https://github.com/jgoulah/playlister/commit/88924108287ac0060ddde613152c12ff71000488#diff-14" target="_blank">songs.js</a> file.

### Querying the Song

When someone enters a song into the textbox and clicks enter, we query the echonest api for the song.

So basically what we&#8217;re doing here is querying the echonest API for the song name using [JSONP][1]. We run the results through the <a title="underscore.js" href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore" target="_blank">underscore.js</a> [_each][2] function, which for each song in the result set, verifies that it has a foreign_id, which in echonest holds the Rdio ID that we can pass to the player.

A couple other things to note that &#8220;new TempSongList&#8221; creates a TempSongList collection that we&#8217;ve defined while &#8220;new Song&#8221; creates a Song model that we then add to this collection. At the end of the method call &#8220;new SongPickView&#8221; to create the SongPickView view and render it onto the page.

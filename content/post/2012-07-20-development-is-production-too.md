I was at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012" title="OSCON" target="_blank">OSCON</a> this week, and my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kastner" target="_blank">Erik Kastner</a> and I did a talk about development environments. Specifically what to avoid and how to keep environments consistent across development and production. As usual the slides are not fully explanatory without seeing the accompanying talk but here they are anyway:
